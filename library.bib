               representation as a motivated iteration in which, in succession,
               practice confronts theory, and theory, practice. Rapid progress
               requires sufficient flexibility to profit from such
               confrontations, and the ability to devise parsimonious but
               effective models, to worry selectively about model inadequacies
               and to employ mathematics skillfully but appropriately. The
               development of statistical methods at Rothamsted Experimental
               Station by Sir Ronald Fisher is used to illustrate these themes.",

  abstract  = "Scientific learning is an iterative process employing Criticism
               and Estimation. Correspondingly the formulated model factors
               into two complementary parts--a predictive part allowing model
               criticism, and a Bayes posterior part allowing estimation.
               Implications for significance tests, the theory of precise
               measurement and for ridge estimates are considered. Predictive
               checking functions for transformation, serial correlation, bad
               values, and their relation with Bayesian options are considered.
               Robustness is seen from a Bayesian viewpoint and examples are
               given. For the bad value problem a comparison with M estimators
               is made.",
